									<h2>PC Assemble Lab</h2>
									<p>The PC assembly lab was a great experience for me, as it gave me knowledge and skills beyond the theoretical understanding. I got hands-on experience of assembling and re-assembling computers in a team which was one of the most significant gains. It is through this practical exposure that I gained deeper insight into computer hardware and improved my problem-solving abilities pertaining to connections and troubleshooting during the assembly process.
									   From motherboards to power supplies, I have learned the inner workings of a computer in totality. I have become knowledgeable about the intricate connections and interconnectivity among different parts, which has broadened my views on technology beyond conventional classroom learning.
									   Activities involved handling components, joining cables and fastening objects together which added to my practical skills. This physical interaction linked up with academic ideas presented during lectures hence making it easier to understand what was taught.
									   My sincere thanks go to Dr. Azurah, as well as all other technicians who offered their guidance and assistance throughout these lab sessions. Their proficiency plus the guidance they gave me during this period</p>
									
									<h2>Assignment 1 - Poster on Industry Talk</h2>
									<blockquote><p>The Clarity Techworks Industrial Talk provided valuable insights inti ICT roles and Fintech intricacies. I deepened my understanding of Android development. UI/UX design, QA testing, and web development, emphasizing adaptibility, perseverance, and continuous learning for a successful ICT career. As for improvement, it is better to do practical demonstration to help student understand better.</p></blockquote>

										<h2>Assignment 2 - Video on UTM Digital</h2>
										
									</header>
									<blockquote><p>From this activity, I get the knowledge of how the workplace runs, I also able to try out new technologies (HUAWEI IdeaHub), learn about the importance of the data centre and this experience provided us with a peek into how UTM Digital operates.I suggest that a sound feedback mechanism and networking opportunities should be implemented for improvement purposes. To institute a feedback system that was structured would give students the power to express their opinions concerning the visit to the industry. In addition, this helpful feedback could provide organizers with ideas about what worked well and how to improve future visits. Lastly, by providing an opening for dialogue via feedback channels, transparency is encouraged while also giving room for the organizers to adjust and customize future experiences to match participants’ demands as well as expectations. These are just some of the reasons why incorporating networking opportunities during these visits would definitely make them more interesting since it will help enrich the experience as a whole and enable students make connections with each other, share their thoughts or maybe start building relationships which can be beneficial in terms of future research or even career growth.</p></blockquote>

									<h2>Assignment 3 - Industrial Talk 2 Report</h2>
									<text-align:justify></text-align:justify>
									<blockquote><p class: justifier> In brief, a varied toolkit is necessary for systems development because it encompasses project management, analysis, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance. The selection of specific technologies and tools heavily depends on the project’s requirements, scope, as well as the inclinations and expertise of the developers. In my judgment it will require me to have a strategic approach that involves continuous learning, hands-on experience and effective networking in order to chart my path into becoming an accomplished developer within the next four years. Continuous Learning’s emphasis is important to me because keeping up with the newest technologies as well as industry trends provides a solid foundation for success. It is also worth noting that taking part in online courses, workshops and obtaining other relevant certifications is an active way of enhancing skills and ensuring adaptability in this rapidly changing technological environment. Moreover, I am certain that getting engaged in practical assignments is highly significant too. Application of theoretical knowledge through practical tasks assists in building practical skills. I definitely have confidence that making actual applications can serve more than understanding purposes but also serve as a tangible portfolio for employers who might want to factually prove their capacity before employing me.</p></blockquote>

									<h3>Assignment 4 - Newsletter on Industry Talk 3</h3>
								    <p><span class="image left"><img src="" alt="" /></span>From this industry talk,I get several insights about the I-Farm technology. This technology uses an e-commerce platform as a marketplace that helps residents get their orders of a variety of vegetables from their homes. Apart from that, I-Farm also uses IoT technology that enables real-time monitoring of vegetable growth to maintain high-quality vegetables. In my opinion, I-Farm technology will function as food security. By creating a dependable source of locally grown, pesticide-free vegetables,I-Farm improves food security by addressing the shortage of fresh vegetables during any difficulties, such as MCO.</p>
									<h3> Assignment - Initial Design Thinking Report</h3>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="" alt="" /></span>Undertaking design thinking projects really impacted my aspiration of becoming a competent data analyst. My problem-solving horizon was broadened through this methodology, which stressed the need for identifying predominant trends during problem analysis. The structured steps of design thinking are empathy, define, ideate, prototype, and test, which are effective in generating best possible solutions. This exercise improved my skills in critical thinking while the knowledge I have obtained will greatly help me with systematic data analysis which is necessary for improved performance as a data analyst.

										Additionally, I plan to better my industry skills by enrolling to online studies in various fields; attending workshops like Jazari workshop, UTM and participating in conferences among other things. Reading relevant books and articles frequently is an easy but efficient method of keeping abreast with rapidly changing tools and technologies in the field.</p>

									<h2>Assignment - Design Thinking Report</h2>
									<div class="box">
										<p>Regarding the course that I studied, which is computer network and security, my ambition is to become the top data analyst in Malaysia. In order to achieve my biggest goal, I need to realize that the key to being a good data analyst is technical skills such as programming languages such as Phyton and SQL, data visualization tools like Tableau, and database management tools. Thus, I must be able to analyze and draw insights from the data. Despite that, I need to always keep up with the latest technology to make sure my chances of getting a job as a data analyst are higher.
											These design thinking projects have a big impact on my goal to become a competent data analyst. This project expanded my vision of how I can solve problems and the correct way to analyze problems by identifying common patterns among all the problems listed. By applying defined phases in design thinking, I am able to create problem statements and have a clear vision of what problems I should solve in order to generate the best solution. Apart from that, this assessment developed my critical thinking skills on another level. I never thought that just following the five steps—empathy, define, ideate, prototype, and test—in design thinking could produce an efficient solution to a problem. The knowledge and experience I gain from applying design thinking will surely help me a lot to analyze and draw insights from the data in the most efficient and systematic way. As a result, I will be able to perform better in my work as a data analyst.
											I have many plans to improve myself in the industry, like taking online courses and attending workshops like the Jazari workshop at the University of Technology Malaysia, UTM. Other than that, I can also participate in industry conferences, and the easiest thing I can do is keep reading relevant books and articles. All of this is to make sure that I stay up-to-date with the latest tools, techniques, and technologies since this field is rapidly evolving.
